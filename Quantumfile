# General project information.
project:
  version: 1.0.0
  name: Universal Subject Resolver

# This section specifies additional properties of the deployment
# environment for the usr service.
deployment:

  # The deployment realm is either 'perimeter' (public-facing
  # services), 'citadel' (core internal service), business
  # (services implementing the business domain) or 'auxilary'
  # (supporting services).
  realm: citadel


# This section describes the characteristics of the SG generated
# application.
app:

  # Indicates that the application requires a relational database systen. Quantum
  # services are assumed to connect to one RDBMS only.
  rdbms: true

  # Specifies the roles that the application has. Valid values are
  # 'http', 'handler', 'runner', 'listener' or 'scheduler'.
  roles:
  - http


# Basic Python package configuration and settings.
package:
  language: python

  # This is the name of the Python module that contains the application
  # code, and is also used as a general identifier for this service.
  name: usr

  # Python module requirements from PyPi. Specified as in a requirements.txt,
  # file.
  requirements: []


# Application environment settings and variables.
environ:
  prefix: true # Prefix environment variables with USR_
  variables:
  - name: SECRET_KEY
    default: 30b465e0c882f37671cca0f142ec292493c1009c0baa0a39aa684b1259301460
    comment: Not for production use!
  - name: RDBMS_DSN
    default: postgresql+psycopg2://usr:usr@rdbms:5432/usr
  - name: HTTP_ADDR
    default: '0.0.0.0'
  - name: HTTP_PORT
    default: '8443'


# The application is currently not configured as an event listener. To
# enable this feature, add the 'listener' role to the #/app/roles list.
listener:

  # Lists all events that the application subscribes to. This does not
  # imply that it knows how to handle them (i.e., has a handler function
  # configured), only that it wants to receive them.
  events: []

  # The list below configures the event handlers that are run on each
  # incoming event message (individual handlers may choose to drop
  # messages). Each item in the list is a dictionary, having at least
  # a `qualname` member, specifying the Python qualified name (e.g.
  # import path) to the event handler *class*. For more information on
  # event handler classes, refer to the Sovereign Quantum documentation.
  handlers:
  - qualname: sq.event.NullEventHandler

  # Specifies the channel from which this application will receive
  # its event messages. Event messages are assumed to be routed
  # according to the criteria specified above.
  channel: usr.events.ingress


# Security related settings.
security:

  # A generic application secret that may be used, for example, to generate
  # signed cookies or other message signatures. This value MUST NOT be used in
  # production, and exists for development and testing purposes only.
  secret_key: 30b465e0c882f37671cca0f142ec292493c1009c0baa0a39aa684b1259301460

  tls:

    # A snakeoil X.509 certificate that is used to enable Transport Level Security (TLS)
    # in non-production environments. Like `secret_key`, this configuration MUST NOT
    # be used in production. Additional hostnames may be specified in the `hostnames`
    # section.
    hostnames:
    - usr
